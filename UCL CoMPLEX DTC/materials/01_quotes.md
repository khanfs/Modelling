_[T]he best material model for a cat is another, or preferably the same, cat._

\hfill Norbert Wiener / Arturo Rosenblueth

_The purpose of models is not to fit the data but to sharpen the questions._

\hfill Samuel Karlin

_To call in the statistician after the experiment is done may be no more than asking him to perform a post-mortem examination: he may be able to say what the experiment died of._

\hfill Ronald Fisher

_With four parameters I can fit an elephant, and with five I can make him wiggle his trunk._

\hfill John von Neumann

\newpage

_If the difficulty of a physiological problem is mathematical in essence, ten physiologists ignorant of mathematics will get precisely as far as one physiologist ignorant of mathematics, and no further. If a physiologist who knows no mathematics works together with a mathematician who knows no physiology, the one will be unable to state his problem in term that the other can manipulate, and the second will be unable to put the answers in any form that the first can understand._

\hfill Norbert Wiener
