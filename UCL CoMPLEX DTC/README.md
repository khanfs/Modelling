# Advanced Biological Modelling and Bioinformatics (ABMB)

## Introduction to the course
These six sessions comprise the first part of the **Advanced Biological Modelling and Bioinformatics (ABMB)** course for students on the [UCL CoMPLEX DTC](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/complex).
The sessions are focused on the construction and use of models of biological processes, and an introduction to the mathematical tools required therein.

## Aims
- To discuss the concept of mathematical modelling, and to encourage critical thinking when determining simplifications and assumptions for models.
- To develop the careful analysis and criticism of models â€“ both those published and those from the students' own work.
- To introduce some of the mathematical techniques most commonly used in the construction of models in the life sciences.

## Intended learning outcomes (ILOs)
At the end of the course, students should be able to:

- *Compare* different areas of mathematics useful for constructing models.
- *Explain* the relevance of a given modelling technique to a given biological problem.
- *Critique* the assumptions made in construction of a model.
- *Interpret* the results of a model, in the context of the original biological scenario.
- *Develop* a suitable approach for modelling a given biological problem, and *reflect* on what the assumptions chosen would imply for the conclusions drawn.

## Content (TBC)
- **Theory of mathematical modelling:** simplifications; assumptions; critical analysis; interpretation of results.
- **Nondimensionalisation and scaling**
- **Dynamical system theory:** ordinary differential equations; phase plane analysis; bifurcation theory.
- **Population models:** continuous population models; discrete population models; interacting populations; dynamics of infectious diseases.
- **Markov chain models:** the Monte-Carlo method.

## Lectures (TBC)
1. An introduction to modelling
2. Discrete systems
